# Setup Handle and Templates
Every account comes with a public page or microsite for directing customers to the platform(s) you accept reviews on.  Every microsite can have a custom handle that customers are referred to when collecting reviews and can be shared publicly. 

## Select a @ Handle
You can select any handle that is available and appropriate for your business.  For example our public page is [https://yuphub.com/@yuphub](https://yuphub.com/@yuphub), our handle is @yuphub.  If you choose not to create a handle your account is assigned a number and your review request will send customers to an unassuming url.

## Email Template
In the settings section you can personalize the standard email template.  Each template has variables like {name} and {business} that are filled in the email.

## Text Message (SMS) Template
In the settings section you can personalize the standard text message template.  Each template can have an image and variables that are filled when the message is sent.

## Review Platforms
In settings, select Review Landing Page to add Review Platforms.  Click on the Review Platform or Edit Review Platform link.  A window will pop up with the options to select Google My Business, Yelp, Twitter and more.
